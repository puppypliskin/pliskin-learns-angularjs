#pliskin-learns-angularjs

I am reading a book called "AngularJS Up and Running". Samples codes I create/encounter during my study will be placed here. There will be some additional notes or tweaks from me here and there as demonstatrations of how I understand concepts and syntax. Hopefully, these are correct. ^_^
