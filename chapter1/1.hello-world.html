<!--
    The "ng-app" directive means AngularJS can work on anything in the <body> tag.
    AngularJS elements will be properly interpreted inside.
    
    My mistake(s):
    1. Earlier, even if I used AngularJS directives (ng-app, ng-model, ng-bind), 
       my page didn't display properly because I failed to include the AngularJS
       API through the <script> tag.

<body ng-app>
    <input type="text" ng-model="name" placeholder="Enter your name">
    <h1>Hello <span ng-bind="name"></span></h1>

<script
    src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.19/angular.js">
</script>
</body>
