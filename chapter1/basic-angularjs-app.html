    Hmmm... this is weird. I read from "Professional Javascript for Web Developers"
    that placing the <script> tag at the end of the page outside the <body> and before
    the <html> improves performance. However, when I view the source from the resulting 
    web page, the script below is is colored red, like an indication of en HTML error...
    
    Now, I'm a little confused about where to really place the script tag.
    For now, I'll copy the placement from "AngularJS Up and Running".
