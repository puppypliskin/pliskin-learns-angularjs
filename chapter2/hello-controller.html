        This is my first module definition. 
        It doesn't have any dependencies yet, hence, the empty array as 2nd parameter.

        The "controller" function is used to define a controller.
        Arguments are the ff:
            a) name of a controller function on the module
            b) array of controller's dependencies
                - names of dependencies of controller
                - last argument is the actual controller function.

        For this case, controller has no dependencies so only the function is defined
        inside the array.

        *This notation for defining controllers is the safe and recommended way.
        There is another way but I'll wrap my mind around that some other time.
        I want to learn and start coding this the right way.

            // Controller-specific code goes here

            this.helloMsg = 'Hello ';
            var goodbyeMsg = 'Goodbye ';
